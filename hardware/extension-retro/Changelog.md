## Changelog

* V6 -- Initial version for this design. The original prototype had address memory 0000 and 0080 readonly at all times. Bit 0 was permanently wired to A7. Bits 2 and 3 would present `MISO0` and `MISO` but only when `SCLK` was set. Therefore when `SCLK` was cleared, reading these addresses would respectively return 00  and 01 as expected by the gigatron software. It turns out that this messes up the routine that measure the available memory immediately after reset, causing the gigatron to occasionnally fail to boot and loop indefinitely (see address 0c in the rom). This was fixed without PCB changes by simply reprogramming the GALs.

* V6b -- This version outputs a special clock line `SCK0` for the SD card that is only active when it is selected, that is, when `/SS0` is cleared. This is designed to prevent the a SPI1 transaction from being interpreted by an inserted SD card that has not yet been put in SPI mode. Because this card in not in SPI mode, it may answer to traffic on `SCK` and `MOSI` even though it is not selected. This is not very probable because the checksums will be wrong. Still I find safer to simply disable its clock line to prevent it from interpreting `MOSI` at all.  Version 6b needs a different program for GAL2.
