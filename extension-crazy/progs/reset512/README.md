# RESET512

This is just a standalone version of the Gigatron reset program.
It can be executed like a normal GT1 or burnt into the ROM.
Its main features are the possibility to detect a 512KB Gigatron
and the possibility to run standalone because it finds the other
programs (MainMenu, CardBook) with SYS_ReadRomDir instead
of having compiled constants.
