# LIBCON_H - High resolution console library

This library overrides the default GLCC console to use double
horizontal and vertical resolution with video buffers located in banks
12,13,14 and 15. This mode provides a video screen of 320x240 pixels
able to display 30 lines of 52 characters.

This only works with the patched ROM.
